# Information-Security-Project


This project is a deliberately vulnerable and secure login and registration web application built using Python, Flask, and SQLite.

It is intended to demonstrate how SQL Injection attacks can be performed when input validation and query parameterization are not properly handled along with demonstrating how hashed passwords and encrypted login credentials, such as email and phone number, work.
